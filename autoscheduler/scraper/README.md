# Scraper

## About

This will consists of two main parts:

1) All of the scraping logic for retrieving data from Howdy/compassxe and loading it into the database
    - In part, this includes all of the main models for the project, such as Course, Section, or Instructor.
2) The view logic for retrieving these models from the database, such as:
    - Retrieving all of the sections for `CSCE-221`.
    - Retrieving the departments that start with "C"
